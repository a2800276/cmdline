There's so much left to do that I don't even know where to start. These are
just notes.

* Rakefile task for submitting to rubyforge. 
  xforge vs. rubyforge (...)
* Dealing with Version Control, automating tagging etc. in Rakefile

* source code commenting
* command line arguments
* dealing with c extensions

* unit testing (runit rcov)
* template for project structure.

* dealing with `data` files (e.g. ZIP code data)
* dealing with non ruby bits (sql, c)

* i18n figure out how to link between documentation files without silly
* link notation
* Release checklist (rubyforge stuff, packaging, updated documentation,
  announcements: mailing lists/RAA/other listings)
